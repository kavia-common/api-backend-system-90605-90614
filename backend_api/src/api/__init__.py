API package initialization.

Contains:
- main: FastAPI application setup and router inclusion.
- routers: modular route definitions (health, users, entities).
- core: settings and database scaffolding.

This package follows the Ocean Professional theme ethos: clean, minimalist, and ready for
future expansion with a database layer while keeping current endpoints lightweight.
